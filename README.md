## Design

The visual design of RaspiMobile aims for a clean, modern, and functional aesthetic that reflects its tech-focused product offering while ensuring a user-friendly experience.

### Color Palette

*   **Primary Color:** A distinct green (`#45c95d`, `#198754`) is used consistently across headers, footers, buttons, active states, and highlights, establishing a strong brand identity.
*   **Accent Colors:** Contrasting colors like yellow/orange are used sparingly for important indicators (e.g., low stock badges). Standard Bootstrap colors (success, danger, warning, info) are utilized for alerts and status badges, providing familiar visual cues.
*   **Background & Text:** A clean white background (`#fff`) is used for main content areas to maximize readability, contrasting with dark text for clarity and green elements for branding.

### Layout & Responsiveness

*   **Bootstrap Framework:** The site heavily utilizes the Bootstrap 5 grid system and components (Navbar, Dropdowns, Buttons, Alerts, List Groups, Cards) to create a structured and consistent layout.
*   **Responsive Design:** All pages are designed to be fully responsive, adapting gracefully to different screen sizes from mobile phones to desktops. Navigation collapses, sidebars transform, and content reflows for optimal viewing on any device.
*   **Sidebar Interaction:** An interactive sidebar provides access to user, cart, and potentially other functions without full page reloads, sliding over or pushing content depending on screen size.
*   **Clear Structure:** Pages like Checkout and Product Details use multi-column layouts to organize information logically (e.g., form vs. summary). Dashboard pages employ list groups and cards for clear presentation of management tasks and data.

### Typography

*   **Font Family:** The primary font used is "Roboto Condensed" (imported via Google Fonts), a clean and readable sans-serif typeface suitable for both headings and body text, contributing to the modern feel.
*   **Hierarchy:** Clear visual hierarchy is established using varying font weights (bold for headings/important info) and sizes, guiding the user's eye through the content.

### Imagery & Icons

*   **Product Images:** Clear, high-quality images are used for product listings and details.
*   **Branding:** The RaspiMobile logo incorporates the recognizable Raspberry Pi symbol, reinforcing the brand's core identity.
*   **Iconography:** FontAwesome icons are used extensively throughout the interface (navigation, buttons, indicators, status messages) to provide quick visual cues and enhance usability without relying solely on text. Icons are consistently styled to match the primary color scheme where appropriate.

## Technical Details / Solutions

### Core Technologies

RaspiMobile is built using a modern web stack focused on Python and Django, leveraging several key technologies:

*   **Backend:** Django (Python framework), PostgreSQL (Database, typical for production).
*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), Bootstrap 5 (CSS Framework).
*   **User Authentication:** `django-allauth` for robust handling of registration, login, logout, and potential social authentication.
*   **Image Handling:** Cloudinary Python SDK (`cloudinary`) for cloud-based image storage, transformations, and delivery.
*   **Payment Processing:** Stripe API (specifically Payment Intents and Stripe Elements) for secure, PCI-compliant payment handling.
*   **Asynchronous Communication:** Django views handle standard requests, while JavaScript Fetch API is used for AJAX calls (Cart updates, Dashboard statistics). Stripe Webhooks handle asynchronous payment confirmations.
*   **Charting:** Chart.js library for rendering dynamic and interactive charts in the staff dashboard.
*   **Form Handling:** Django Forms, `django-crispy-forms` with the Bootstrap 5 template pack for rendering dashboard forms efficiently.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** VADER Sentiment library for basic sentiment analysis of product reviews.
*   **Icons:** FontAwesome for scalable vector icons.

### Key Implementation Details

*   **Interactive Sidebar & AJAX Cart:** The sidebar (containing user info, cart, etc.) uses JavaScript to toggle visibility and Bootstrap's Carousel component. Cart operations (add/remove) utilize the Fetch API to send asynchronous POST requests to dedicated Django views. These views process the request, update the database or session, render updated HTML partials for the sidebar content and messages, and return JSON responses. The JavaScript then dynamically updates the relevant sections of the page without a full reload, providing a smooth user experience.
*   **Stripe Payment Flow:**
    1.  **Checkout:** Order details (shipping, items, delivery) are finalized.
    2.  **Payment Page:** A Django view (`PaymentView`) creates a Stripe PaymentIntent on the backend, passing the `client_secret` and `public_key` to the template.
    3.  **Stripe Elements:** JavaScript (`stripe_elements.js`) uses the received keys to initialize Stripe.js and mount the secure Payment Element, which collects payment details directly via Stripe's servers.
    4.  **Confirmation:** On form submission, JavaScript calls `stripe.confirmPayment`, redirecting the user to Stripe for any necessary authentication (like 3D Secure) and then back to the site's Order Confirmation page.
    5.  **Webhook Verification:** A dedicated webhook handler view (`StripeWebhookView`) listens for asynchronous events from Stripe (e.g., `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`), verifies the signature, updates the order status in the database accordingly, and triggers confirmation emails.
*   **Dynamic Dashboard Statistics:** The statistics page uses JavaScript (`statistics_charts.js`) and Chart.js. Initial data is loaded via Django template context. When a user selects a different date range, an AJAX request (Fetch API) is sent to a dedicated endpoint within the `DashboardStatisticsView`. The Django view queries the database based on the requested range, aggregates the data, and returns it as JSON. The JavaScript then updates the corresponding Chart.js instance dynamically.
*   **Review Auto-Approval:** The `ReviewForm`'s `save` method incorporates VADER sentiment analysis. Before saving, it analyzes the review comment's sentiment. If the compound score meets a positive threshold, the `is_approved` flag is automatically set to `True`, allowing positive reviews to appear immediately while others await manual moderation.
*   **Responsive Design:** Bootstrap 5's grid system, utility classes, and components are used throughout to ensure the layout adapts effectively to various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

### Model Relationships

The database schema is designed to logically connect different aspects of the e-commerce platform:

*   **User & Profile:** Django's built-in `User` model (`settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL`) is used. A separate `ShippingAddress` model (in `profiles`) has a ForeignKey to `User`, allowing users to save their address details.
*   **Products & Categories:** A `Product` can belong to multiple `Category` instances via a ManyToManyField.
*   **Products & Specifications:** A `Product` can have multiple `ProductSpecification` entries. Each `ProductSpecification` links the `Product` to a specific `SpecificationType` (e.g., "Color") and holds the `value` (e.g., "Blue"). `SpecificationType` can also be linked to `Category` (ManyToMany) to help organize available specs.
*   **Products & Reviews:** A `Review` belongs to one `Product` (ForeignKey) and one `User` (ForeignKey). A unique constraint ensures a user can only review a specific product once.
*   **Orders & Users/Carts:** An `Order` can optionally belong to a registered `User` (ForeignKey, SET_NULL) and can optionally be linked back to the `Cart` it originated from (ForeignKey, SET_NULL).
*   **Orders & Items:** An `Order` contains multiple `OrderItem` instances (via a ForeignKey from `OrderItem` to `Order` with `related_name='items'`). Each `OrderItem` links to one `Product` (ForeignKey) and stores the quantity and price *at the time of the order*.
*   **Orders & Delivery:** An `Order` is associated with one `DeliveryMethod` (ForeignKey, SET_NULL).

## Testing

A comprehensive testing strategy was employed to ensure the quality, performance, accessibility, and reliability of the RaspiMobile application across various aspects.

### Lighthouse Scores

Google Lighthouse was used extensively to audit key pages (including Home, Product List, Product Detail, Cart, Checkout, Profile, and Dashboard pages where applicable) for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO. Both mobile and desktop scores were analyzed to ensure a good user experience on all devices.

### W3C Validation (HTML & CSS)

*   **HTML:** The generated HTML for publicly accessible pages and dashboard templates was validated using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). Efforts were made to resolve validation errors and warnings, ensuring compliance with HTML5 standards. *(Note: Some pages requiring login might not have been directly validated via the online tool).*

*   **CSS:** The custom CSS (`static/css/style.css`) was checked using the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). While the validator flagged some errors related to modern CSS features like **CSS Nesting**, these features are now widely supported by modern browsers and were used intentionally for code organization and maintainability. The core layout and styles rendered correctly across target browsers despite these validation warnings, which are primarily due to the validator not being fully up-to-date with the latest CSS specifications.


### Code Validation (Linters)

*   **Python:** The Python code across all Django apps (home, products, cart, orders, profiles, dashboard) was checked for adherence to PEP8 standards and potential errors using a linter (e.g., Flake8, Pylint, or an online tool like PEP8CI).

### Manual & Browser Testing

Manual testing was performed throughout the development process to ensure core user flows work as expected:

*   Browsing products, searching, sorting, and filtering.
*   Adding/removing items from the cart (guest and logged-in).
*   Completing the checkout process.
*   Submitting product reviews.
*   Using the staff dashboard features (CRUD operations, status updates).
*   User registration, login, and logout.

The application was tested on the following browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility:

*   Google Chrome (Latest Version)
*   Mozilla Firefox (Latest Version)

Responsiveness was checked using browser developer tools across various common screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

## Deployment

This project is deployed on **Heroku**. The live application can be accessed here:

#### [Visit RaspiMobile Deployed Site](link-to-your-deployed-site) <!-- Update this link -->

### Platform Choice

Heroku was chosen for its ease of use, seamless integration with GitHub for continuous deployment, extensive add-on market (like Heroku Postgres), and straightforward configuration for Django applications.

### Pre-deployment Project Setup

Before deploying to Heroku, the following configurations were essential:

1.  **`requirements.txt`:** Created to list all Python dependencies (`pip freeze > requirements.txt`), including:
    *   `django`
    *   `gunicorn` (Production WSGI server)
    *   `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg2`) (PostgreSQL adapter)
    *   `dj-database-url` (To parse `DATABASE_URL` environment variable)
    *   `whitenoise` (To serve static files efficiently)
    *   `cloudinary`, `dj3-cloudinary-storage` (For Cloudinary integration)
    *   `stripe` (For Stripe payments)
2.  **`Procfile`:** Created in the root directory to define process types:
    *   `web: gunicorn your_project_name.wsgi:application` (Tells Heroku how to run the web server, replace `your_project_name` with your actual Django project folder name).
    *   `release: python manage.py migrate`.
3.  **Static Files Configuration (`settings.py` & `wsgi.py`):**
    *   Configured `STATIC_URL`, `STATICFILES_DIRS`, and `STATIC_ROOT`.
    *   Added `whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware` to `MIDDLEWARE`.
4.  **Database Configuration (`settings.py`):**
    *   Used `dj_database_url.parse()` to configure the `DATABASES['default']` setting, reading from the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
    *   Set `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1` as a temporary Heroku config var during the *first* deployment if needed, then removed it.
5.  **Security & Production Settings (`settings.py`):**
    *   Set `DEBUG = False` (controlled via environment variable).
    *   Configured `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to include the Heroku app URL and any custom domains.
    *   Ensured `SECRET_KEY` was read from an environment variable, not hardcoded.
    *   Configured `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` to include the Heroku app URL (`https://*.herokuapp.com` or specific URL).
6.  **`.python-version` :** Created to specify the desired Python version (e.g., `python-3.13`).

### Heroku Deployment Steps

1.  **Create Heroku Account & App:**
    *   Sign up/log in at [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).
    *   Create a new app, choosing a unique name and region.
2.  **Set Config Vars:**
    *   Navigate to the "Settings" tab and click "Reveal Config Vars".
    *   Add all necessary environment variables, including:
        *   `SECRET_KEY` (Generate a new strong and complicated password for production)
        *   `CLOUDINARY_URL`
        *   `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`
        *   `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
        *   `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
        *   `DATABASE_URL`
        *   `ALLOWED_HOSTS` ('127.0.0.1', '.herokuapp.com')
        *   `EMAIL_HOST_USER`, `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`, etc.
        *   `DEBUG=0` (Set to 0 or False for production)
        *   `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1` (Only needed temporarily for the very first deployment if static files cause issues, then remove).
3.  **Connect GitHub & Deploy:**
    *   Navigate to the "Deploy" tab.
    *   Select "GitHub" as the deployment method.
    *   Search for and connect the project's GitHub repository.
    *   Choose either:
        *   **Automatic Deploys:** Enable this for a specific branch (e.g., `main`) to automatically redeploy whenever code is pushed to that branch.
        *   **Manual Deploy:** Select a branch and click "Deploy Branch" to trigger a deployment manually.

This configured deployment ensures the Django application, its dependencies, database, static files, and sensitive settings are correctly handled in the Heroku production environment.
