## E-commerce Business Model

### Necessity and Focus

RaspiMobile operates primarily under a **Business-to-Consumer (B2C)** e-commerce model. The core necessity for this online platform is to serve as the **direct sales channel** for our unique Raspberry Pi-based tablets, phones, and accessories. By selling directly to end-users, we can:

1.  **Control the Narrative:** Effectively communicate the value proposition of modularity, longevity, user control, and open-source software options directly to the target audience.
2.  **Manage Inventory & Pricing:** Efficiently manage stock levels (potentially enhanced by the mentioned "AI inventory" concept, though not detailed in the provided code) and maintain control over pricing strategy.
3.  **Build Customer Relationships:** Foster a direct relationship with customers for support, feedback, and community building around the products.
4.  **Reach a Niche Market:** Directly target the specific demographic interested in Raspberry Pi, Linux, open hardware, and sustainable technology, which might be harder to reach effectively through traditional retail channels.

While future B2B possibilities could exist (e.g., bulk educational sales), the current application structure and user flow are focused on individual consumer purchases.

### Core Business Intents

The primary business intents for the RaspiMobile e-commerce platform are:

1.  **Generate Revenue:** Directly sell RaspiMobile hardware (tablets, phones) and accessories.
2.  **Promote Brand Philosophy:** Showcase the commitment to "True Device Freedom," modularity, sustainability, and user control as key differentiators.
3.  **Educate Consumers:** Inform potential buyers about the benefits and capabilities of Raspberry Pi Compute Module-based devices and the choice of operating systems.
4.  **Build Community (Implied):** Create a space where users can potentially share experiences (through reviews initially) and feel part of a movement against planned obsolescence.
5.  **Gather Feedback:** Use reviews and potentially other interaction channels to improve products and services.

### Marketing Strategies

To reach the target demographic, RaspiMobile would employ strategies focusing on its unique selling points:

1.  **Content Marketing:** Creating blog posts, tutorials, and videos showcasing the capabilities, customization options, and repairability of RaspiMobile devices (targeting Raspberry Pi, Linux, and DIY communities).
2.  **Community Engagement:** Participating in relevant online forums, subreddits (like r/raspberry_pi, r/linux), and potentially sponsoring related open-source projects or events.
3.  **Search Engine Optimization (SEO):** Optimizing product pages and content for keywords related to "Raspberry Pi tablet," "modular phone," "Linux phone," "repairable tablet," etc.
4.  **Social Media Marketing:** Targeting platforms frequented by tech enthusiasts (e.g., Facebook, specific tech groups on other platforms, potentially YouTube) with content highlighting the devices' features and philosophy.
5.  **Influencer Collaboration:** Partnering with tech reviewers and influencers within the Raspberry Pi and open-source communities.
6.  **Email Marketing:** Building a newsletter list (via the Mailchimp integration) to announce new products, software updates, and special offers.


## Features

*   **Sorting Options:** Users can sort the displayed products by various criteria, including rating, price (low-high, high-low), and newest arrivals, using a dedicated sort dropdown.
*   **Product Card Information:** Each product card displays the image, name, price (in Euros), average user rating (visual stars and numerical value), and a direct "Add to Cart" button.
*   **Stock Availability:** Visual cues, like a "Low Stock" badge, inform customers about limited inventory for specific items.
